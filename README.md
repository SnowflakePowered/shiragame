## About

shiragame is a games database that allows you to look up game titles by ROM hash, or serial. Unlike other games databases, shiragame is updated consistently every week with the newest updates from its contributing cataloguing organizations. The latest release is always available at [https://git.io/JfFij](https://github.com/SnowflakePowered/shiragame/releases/latest/download/shiragame.zip).

shiragame also guarantees a semantically versioned schema for the convenience of its users. See [shiratsu](https://github.com/SnowflakePowered/shiratsu) for the database schema specification. 

A new revision of shiragame is published approximately once a month. Database generation is automated with [shiratsu](https://github.com/SnowflakePowered/shiratsu).

## Legal
